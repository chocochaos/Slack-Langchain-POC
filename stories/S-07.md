# As a Slack user, I want an AI agent to help me write user stories in markdown format, so that I can maintain consistent story documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- When I send a message on Slack containing !story and my description of what needs to be done, an agent should reply with a properly formatted user story
- The story should follow the repository's established markdown format:
  - Title must be on a single line: `# As a ... I want ... so that ...`
  - Followed by acceptance criteria section
- The output should be wrapped in a code block for better readability in Slack
- The agent should maintain a consistent style with existing stories
- Acceptance criteria should be specific and testable

## Implementation Details
- Create new story agent with:
  - Model: GPT-4 (best for understanding context and maintaining consistent format)
  - Temperature: 0.7 (balanced between creativity and consistency)
  - Use ChatOpenAI instead of OpenAI (required for GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo as they are chat models)
  - Prompt template that emphasizes:
    - User story format in markdown syntax
    - Repository's story structure
