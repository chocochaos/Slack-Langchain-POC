# As a developer, I want agents to be well-organized and configurable, so that they are easier to maintain and customize

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each agent should be in its own directory with its implementation and configuration files.
- Each agent's configuration (prompt template, temperature, etc.) should be defined in a YAML file.
- Configuration files should be located in the agent's directory as `config.yaml`.
- Agent implementations should be clean and focused on logic, with all configuration moved to YAML files.
- The base agent should automatically load configuration from the correct location.
- Documentation should clearly explain how to find and modify agent configurations.

## Implementation Details
- Create separate directories for each agent (addition, echo, reverse)
- Each agent directory must contain:
  - `agent.py`: The agent implementation
  - `config.yaml`: Agent-specific configuration
  - `__init__.py`: Package exports
- Enhance BaseAgent with automatic configuration loading using `__init_subclass__`
- Implement smart agent registration with proper class initialization
- Update documentation to reflect the new structure
